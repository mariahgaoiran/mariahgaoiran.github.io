Thank you, Smash Mouth, for throwing away ancient ideas to emphasize how external impressions are everything. In terms of Git, the computer science community cannot hold down their hype -- and it is for good reason.

I am in all ways a rookie to the configuration management scene. Though I have heard of the wonders of Git, I have not used it before this year, and thus, am just experiencing it's glory.

Previous projects would have been so much easier had I known effective configuration management.
