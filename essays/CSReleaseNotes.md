# CollaborativeStudy (CS) Release Notes

On those dates, you must update your repository and documentation to reflect the current state of the system, and publish a technical essay containing "Release Notes" that discusses what you worked on during the previous two weeks, the obstacles you faced, what new features are part of the system, and what you plan to accomplish during the next two weeks. You can have a single technical essay called "<Project> Release Notes", where <Project> is the name of your project. This essay can be updated every two weeks with a new section discussing the new release. Provide a link to your updated release notes essay in the #releasenotes channel so I know it's ready for review.
