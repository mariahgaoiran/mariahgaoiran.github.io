If you saw me when I was younger, I would usually be carrying one of three things: a pencil, a cello bow, or a controller. The pencil, because I have always loved art, especially drawing. The bow, because I loved to play music. The controller, because I loved robotics and video games. But when it came to picking a career in college, I went with the most logical choice: robotics, which translated into computer science.

Art, music, and robotics have been with me for such a long time that I want to try towards a career where I can incorporate the three. I want to know if software engineering is the path to accomplishing that. I suspect it requires a lot of the creativity that art and music have in common. It can be used to create tools to support such interests as well, so I expect the class to help me find in what ways exactly art and music can be incorporated into computer science. 

I am one week into my first Software Engineering class. It has already been a ride and we have only been making accounts for job networking sites, not even beginning on the skills pertaining specifically to software engineering. Whether I find my passion in this class or not, I am excited to see what the field truly entails and am thus excited for the classes to come.
