The fact that Semantic UI was intended to be user friendly terrifies me.

The simple class names, the versatile reuse of variations, the easy organization of terms -- all struck fear into my heart for what reason? Because learning this framework was hard!

# It's called "learning", but...

It's not so much "learning" a framework as it is getting used to one. Through the instruction of my software engineering professor, we were introduced to Semantic UI through a series of videos explaining every little element, collection, view, and module it included. I will be the first to admit that in those approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes, I had effectively learned how to: 1) position my laptop so as to watch videos while lying on the floor and 2) fall asleep in this position. There was no way I would be able to memorize all the content the video chose to bombard me with. Semantic UI provides a great variety of options that can easily overwhelm someone.

# I can just rely on the docs... right?

Though they all generally had the same format for implementation, there are little nuances to each class that must be used. Even though I can recognize that I want to create an instance of a "ui menu", I have to remember that menus take "items" within them. I don't have to put words as a "text" class, or within a paragraph tag as I would for a different collection.

In this way, though I had a general idea of how to implement something, I still had to refer to the Semantic UI documentation to ascertain I was coding it correctly. This takes a brutal attack on time and efficiency, which is frustrating to handle. While I'm sure in time I will be able to use this framework with more familiarity, it is still difficult in the time being to have to constantly refer to documentation.

Worse still is the naming of the classes. They're simple, like "ui container", with variations like "inverted", "fitted", and "red". When read, it is quite obvious what is being created. Yet, when looking for the right class to use without knowing any class names first, it's rather difficult. If I wanted a menu to appear fixed at the top of a page, is that "fixed"? Is it "fitted", "fluid", "top", or "attached"? With so many options, it's almost as if this simplification of terms has again given the programmer an overwhelming amount of choices.

# But in time, it will surely come.

Being the only UI framework I've used, I can't compare Semantic UI to other frameworks to assess it's worth. I do believe, however, that getting accustomed to this framework will take time an practice. Time and practice I am willing to commit because the result so far, while slow, have been much more rich and interesting than the html/css pages I've been creating. Hopefully, with this framework, I can create web pages I am proud of.
