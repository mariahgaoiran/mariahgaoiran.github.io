Any sane person undergoing stricter standard changes would find it troublesome to have to suddenly care about a problem that wasn't an issue the day before. ESLint, a code quality tool I use with IntelliJ, was created to drive these such people insane. 

Even when I believed I was a clean programmer, ESLint seemed to have a problem with my spacing. Wanted to throw a fit if there wasn't a newline at the end of a file. Screamed indecencies because
