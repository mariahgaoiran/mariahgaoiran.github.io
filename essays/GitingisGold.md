Thank you, Smash Mouth, for throwing away ancient ideas to emphasize how external impressions are everything. In terms of Git, the computer science community cannot hold down their hype -- and it is for good reason.

# First Time Adventurer

I am in all ways a rookie to the configuration management scene. Though I have heard of the wonders of Git, I have not used it before this year, and thus, am just experiencing it's glory. After spending a previous semester grappling with a group project's double maintenence and simultaneous update issues, it was bliss to see such problems being solved for me through Git. No longer do I have to worry about who had what copy of the code, what had to be changed into the main file, and worst, figuring out for myself what had changed.

# Git, the true master

GitHub owes its dues to Git. Had Git not existed in the first place, there would be no reason for GitHub to be hosting repositories. People would still be parsing code sent through email because they wouldn't have any better ways to share them. GitHub would just become another storage unit for sharing photos of cats.
