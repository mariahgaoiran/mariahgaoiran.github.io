# Beginning: First time adventurer

I am still a rookie to the configuration management scene. Though I have heard of the wonders of Git, I have not used it before this year, and thus, am just experiencing it's glory. After spending a previous semester grappling with a group project's simultaneous update issues, it was bliss to see such problems being solved for me through Git. No longer do I have to worry about who has what copy of the code, what must to be changed in the master code, and worst, figuring out for myself what has been changed.

# Rising Action: Death Mountain before Kokiri Forest

Everyone knows that the path to success starts out simple before ramping up the difficultly. In videogames, you usually move from the calming beasts of the forest to the terrible monsters of the mountains, not the other way around. Yet GitHub seems to bring out the challenges first.

For something meant to make coding simpler, GitHub has a huge learning curve. What's the difference between forking and branching? What is a pull request? How can I work on the same project with others and not completely screw up all their work? The questions are never-ending to a new user. No matter how clean the interface is - and I'll have you know, GitHub looks quite neat - it is hard to grasp both the concepts of Git and the ways of implementing them through GitHub all at once. It takes a lot of documentation searching and Stack Overflow to figure out the whole mess, and even then you will not understand it all. There are some things that you cannot to do through the Desktop version, which had me reeling.

# Climax: Conflicts, and I don't mean between branches
Out of all the issues I've had with GitHub, the only complaint I have deals with, ironically, conflicts. When trying to merge two branches together, GitHub desktop may stop you to notify you of a conflict between them. After dealing with the confusing format to amend the conflict, GitHub desktop will not recognize the fix and force you to merge through the Git Shell instead. This method is tedious and unnecessary. There is no reason I should have to open another window and type in actual commands to do the same work as the commit button should. If this issue were to be resolved, I believe GitHub would be a lot more bearable.

# Resolution: That was just the first town
Though it was a rough start, Git and GitHub turned out many times to be a savior. When I accidentally destroyed data, it was there to restore it. It was there to create branches so I couldn't destroy it. When I wasn't using Git with my other projects, I would lose data I needed from the previous save and wondered why I didn't use Git. Which led me to wonder: why don't I always use Git and GitHub when I code?

The reality is that I don't need it for little projects, but I should certainly be using it for the larger projects I want to and will be working on in the future. I look forward to working on more collaborative projects and those will certainly require Git. It actually excites me to be able to. It is an indispensable tool that I will bring on any journey with me.
