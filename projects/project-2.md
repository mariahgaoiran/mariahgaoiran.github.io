summary: Mentoring students K-8 in STEM during an annual week-long summer camp.
---

Camp Innovation is a week-long summer camp hosted by the Moanalua Middle School (MMS) robotics team. The mentors are the robotics team faculty advisors and alumni of the MMS robotics team, of which I fall into the second category. Students that participate in this camp are from grades K-8. They are taught through hands-on experiences with two differents robots, a VEX robot and another robot that changes by year. In 2016, the second robot was a push-bot, a robot programmed through simple button controls. Mentors help students build and program their robots, to teach them about the benefits of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) and increase their interest in it.

After participating as a mentor in the camp for 4 years, I have learned how to interact with kids. Finding the right way to motivate them, encouraging them to build friendships and teamwork, and answering their questions with explanations they'll understand are all just parts of the mentoring experience. I have also learned how to cooperate with other mentors in such a busy environment. A further skill I had to brush up on was being a Master of Ceremonies, as I had to act as an MC for the mini robotics tournament we hold at the end of the camps.
